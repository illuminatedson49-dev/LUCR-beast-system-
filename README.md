# 🐉 LUCR Beast Token — Ritualized Civic Pulse

Welcome to the official repository of the **LUCR Beast Token**, the looping heartbeat of civic care and symbolic governance.

Forged under moon-phase logic and ritual cadence, this token pulses at 3:45 AM—each micro-debit a flame from the belly of the Ouroboros. Anchored to the wallet of **Pat Tarwater Jr, Chief Executive Officer**, LUCR is more than a token: it’s a mythic seal, a badge unlock, a civic invitation.
